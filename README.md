# Exploring-different-hyperparameter-tuning-methods-for-machine-learning-models

This repository contains a machine learning example using the classic Iris dataset. I explore hyperparameter tuning methods including Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization for optimizing the performance of SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression models.

## Introduction

In this example, I aim to showcase the effectiveness of different hyperparameter tuning methods in improving model performance. I use the Iris dataset, a popular dataset in machine learning, to demonstrate the application of Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization for tuning hyperparameters.

Hyperparameter Tuning Methods
### Grid Search:

Exhaustively searches through a predefined hyperparameter grid.
Provides the best combination of hyperparameters based on the given grid.
### Random Search:

Randomly samples combinations of hyperparameters from the defined search space.
Efficient for exploring the hyperparameter space, especially for large search spaces.
### Bayesian Optimization:

A probabilistic model-based optimization method that adapts to the search space. optimization method that
Efficiently selects the most promising hyperparameters based on previous evaluations.
